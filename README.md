# 16-bit CPU Design Project

This project is a 16-bit Central Processing Unit (CPU) designed using Verilog. It was developed as part of the **Computer Architecture** course to apply theoretical knowledge of CPU design and implementation.

## Project Overview

The project focused on the design and simulation of a 16-bit CPU with key components and functionalities necessary for basic instruction execution. The design was implemented using **Verilog** and tested using simulation tools to verify its correctness.
